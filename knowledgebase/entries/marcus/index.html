        <p class="indented">Marcus is a currently novel specimen. Not much is known of it or its characteristics. <br>
        Specimen origin points towards the Central Canadian regions. Pictured above is a photograph of the specimen,
      taken mere moments before its photographer was mauled to death. Afterwards, a team of 20-30 Special Interception Units were dispatched to deal with the threat.
    Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful in quelling the beast and a 12-megaton nuclear device was detonated in the area. Radiation and a large crater still remains in the 
  [ INFORMATION CLASSIFIED AS OF 8/31/22 ] forest. Specimen interests include logging and pickup trucks. Specimen forbidden from consumption of vegetables of tuber family for 
classified reasons. Specimen appears to have been reincarnated from some previous form, likely the Saint Marcus III, the specimen namesake. Specimen is to be monitored closely 
for at least 9 hours each day, NO LESS. Dangerous things will happen if this is avoided or not completed. Specimen court-ordered to be released by 7/11/2033.
Legal battle currently ongoing to secure custody of specimen for indefinite period to protect public safety.</p>
