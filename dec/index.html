      <header>Francis E. Dec - A Collection of Works</header>
      <br>
      <p class="indented">Greetings! Welcome to the official UG$ Archive of all known works of Francis E. Dec.
        Listed below is a series of hyperlinks that will direct you to each work, in (as close as possible to) chronological order. Unfortunately,
        Francis was not very good at dating his works, so in many instances, dates may be inaccurate or plain wrong at worst. If you believe any dates are wrong, please contact us.
        If you have ended up on this page with little to no knowledge on who Francis E. Dec was or what he did, we suggest you check out the <a href="/dec/about/"><b>about page</b></a> to learn more.
        All transcriptions are intended to be as close to what was written as possible, down to replacements of "S" with "$", "E"  with "F", and even the random underlining. If you notice any inconsistencies or (unintentional) typos,
        please inform us.
        The titles for each work are determined either by being directly in the text, or being decided upon by trying to capture the essence of the entire work in a few words.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="indented">Disclaimer: Francis was, unfortunately, a severely schizophrenic, raging racist and anti-semite. <b>Obviously, his beliefs and those expressed in his works are not shared by us at the Ultimate Gang$tarz. </b>
  We are fans of his because of the comedic incoherence of his rants, not because of his beliefs. That being said, you should remember that his rants are so absurd and insane
  that they shouldn't really be taken seriously enough to get upset over. While you read, just think about how this man <i>actually</i> believed in these things and was trying to get you to believe him by writing these rants.</p>

        We highly suggest you go check out his website to experience the rants with incredibly fitting visuals and auditory accompaniment as well.</p>
