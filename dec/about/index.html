      <header>About Francis E. Dec</header>
      <br>
      <p class="indented">Welcome to the UG$ Francis E. Dec. Archive. You may, perhaps, be wondering who Francis E. Dec was, and why he is of enough notoriety to warrant
        an archival of all of his works. Well, fear not, as we have created this page to inform you! </p>
      <br>
      <p class="indented">
    Disclaimer: Francis was, unfortunately, a severely schizophrenic, raging racist and anti-semite. <b>Obviously, his beliefs and those expressed in his works are not shared by us at the Ultimate Gang$tarz. </b>
  We are fans of his because of the comedic incoherence of his rants, not because of his beliefs.</p> <br>
        <p class="indented">
        Francis, E. Dec was a Polish-American lawyer born on January 6th, 1926 in Hempstead, New York, where he would live for most, if not all of his life. His immediate
         family consisted of his parents, Rose M. Dec (1890-1967, aged 77) and John F. Dec (1893-1971, aged 78), and his older brother, Joseph I. Dec (1921-2010, aged 89).
        He attended a nunnery Catholic Grammar school from the early 1930s, and then subsequently 3 years of High School from 1940-1943 before enlisting
         to serve in the United States army as a private on April 13th, 1944. He would serve in the army throughout the remainder of the Second World War, though remained 
         stateside throughout his service. He would then be honorarily discharged as a Private First Class on May 11th, 1946. From there he would go on to attend college at
         St. John's University, and, later, Brooklyn Law School through the mid 1950s. On March 31st, 1954, he would be admitted to the New York State Bar as a practicing
         lawyer.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="indented">
        Unfortunately for Francis, on December 23rd, 1958, he would be convicted on two counts of Second Degree Forgery, and sentenced to 2½ to 5 years of hard labor
        in Sing Sing Correctional Facility; however his prison sentence would be suspended and he would instead have to serve probation for the maximum legally allowed period.
        This would later result in his automatic disbarment from the New York State Bar on January 19th, 1959. During his trial throughout 1958, he would write numerous motions
        to the Nassau County Court, all of which were dismissed. After his trial, he would then write several MORE motions, this time to the Supreme Court, all of which were ALSO
        dismissed. These motions contain the first traces of Francis' most infamous aspect; his paranoid schizophrenia. Over the course of his life, it would gradually get worse,
        eventually reaching a breaking point sometime after 1961. From there, he would go completely off the deep end, coming up with conspiracy theories and writing incoherent rants,
        which he would plaster to cars and telephone poles, or mail en masse to random media-related addresses, garnering him a cult following for the sheer absurdity of his writings.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="indented">
        Francis would suffer a stroke and be committed to the St. Albans VA Medical Center sometime between 1992 and 1993. He would later die there, on January 21st, 1996. Somewhat eerily,
        he died exactly 15 days after turning age 70, the age which he believed the Communist Gangster Computer God would confine people to be dead or useless as a result of "Worldwide SYSTEMATIC INSTANT-PLASTIC SURGERY BUTCHERY MURDER, FAKE AGING".

        Pictured to the top left is the photo of a man named Boyd R. "Doc on the ROQ" Britton, more commonly known as simply "Doc Britton", and pictured to the top right is an actual photo of Francis E. Dec.
        <b>Do not confuse these 2 people.</b>
        Doc is, unfortunately, commonly confused for Francis. This is probably because Doc is rather widely known for producing the first
        audio recordings of Francis' rants, and is likely who you hear when you listen to one. Over time, his photo gradually got associated more and more with Francis to the point where his photo
        is now used for Francis' by ill-informed people.
